        <p>In a recent debate against three other schools, none other than our very own St. Xavier's School won! The topic was environmental pollution levels, and five students were selected from each school as a representative. Our five students did an excellent job  portraying the message of how seroius a threat pollution was to our society!</p>

          And all the matches will be played within the school, with the finals to be held on 4 Sept.</p>

   organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions
    of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen
     could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary
      requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling,
       making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

<h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>
<img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >Implemented Online Attendance Management System: This informs parents about
   their child's/children's activities in the school, instantly. Once a student reaches the school, the parents will be informed about the status
    via text messages. This helps schools keep a record of the students absenteeism. Students can mark the attendance by logging in, and this is
     stored in a database, which can later be checked by the Admin. The tracker has so much potential that it can identify which students are
      irregular to their classes and not ready to establish connectivity with the actual concepts of their curriculum's subjects.
       As soon as you enter a student's Enrollment Number or Name, details like availability in classes, number of lectures attended will be
        displayed and no proxies are possible since the tracker is supported by cloud capabilities. Even the security offered can be so robust
         and powerful that those students who always fool their deans are caught in a shorter span just after the admin enters login details 
         into this tracker. All this will improve accuracy and transparency in any of the educational institutions as students and their parents
          are pre-informed about the real-time status of leave requests and absenteeism in a confidential manner and at reduced costs.</p>
